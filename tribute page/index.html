          •Malcolm X was born Malcolm Little on May 19, 1925, in Omaha,
          Nebraska.
        </p>
        <p class="his">
          •His father, Earl Little, was a Baptist preacher and a follower of
          Marcus Garvey, a black nationalist leader.
        </p>
        <p class="his">
          •Malcolm X's childhood was marked by racism, violence, and poverty.
          His family was frequently targeted by the Ku Klux Klan, and his father
          was killed by white supremacists when Malcolm was just six years old.
        </p>
        <p class="his">
          •After dropping out of school at the age of 15, Malcolm X moved to
          Boston, where he became involved in criminal activities and was
          eventually sentenced to 10 years in prison for burglary and larceny.
        </p>
        <p class="his">
          •While in prison, Malcolm X became a devout follower of the Nation of
          Islam, a black nationalist and religious movement led by Elijah
          Muhammad.
        </p>
        <p class="his">
          •After his release from prison in 1952, Malcolm X became a prominent
          spokesperson for the Nation of Islam and a fierce advocate for black
          liberation and self-determination.
        </p>
        <p class="his">
          •Malcolm X's speeches and writings were characterized by their
          uncompromising critique of white supremacy and their call for black
          pride, self-respect, and self-defense.
        </p>
        <p class="his">
          •In 1964, Malcolm X left the Nation of Islam and founded his own
          organization, the Organization of Afro-American Unity, which promoted
          Pan-Africanism and international solidarity among oppressed peoples.
        </p>
        <p class="his">
          •Malcolm X's political views continued to evolve in the last year of
          his life. He became more critical of Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of
          Islam, and he began to embrace a more inclusive and global vision of
          black liberation.
        </p>
        <p class="his">
          •Malcolm X was assassinated on February 21, 1965, while giving a
          speech at the Audubon Ballroom in New York City. Three members of the
          Nation of Islam were convicted of his murder.
        </p>
        <p class="his">
          •Malcolm X's legacy as a revolutionary thinker and activist has
          endured long after his death. He remains a powerful symbol of black
          pride, resistance, and self-determination, and his ideas continue to
          inspire and challenge people around the world.
